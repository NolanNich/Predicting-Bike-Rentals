# Predicting-Bike-Rentals

Hadi Fanaee-T, from the University of Porto, compiled data on the number of bicycles rented from communal bike sharing stations in Washington D.C. We will attempt to predict the total number of bikes rented in a particular hour. We will do this with both a linear regression and decision tree model, and compare the results. 

The data contains 17380 rows and is available from the University of California, Irvine website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset.
